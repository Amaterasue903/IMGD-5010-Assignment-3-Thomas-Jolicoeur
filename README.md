# Cursor Animations
I have personally never done to much with code in general and everyone in their life has to make a mouse trail so my thought was that would be a good next step. I tried to pull inspiration from old windows 7 screensavers i saw while i was in highshool and add my own flair and twist to them within the bounds of my capabilities so I hope you enjoy the 3 I came up with.
